The world is firmly established; it cannot be moved.\",\"3\":\"The seas have lifted up, O LORD, the seas have lifted up their voice; the seas have lifted up their pounding waves.\",\"2\":\"Your throne was established long ago; you are from all eternity.\",\"5\":\"Your statutes stand firm; holiness adorns your house for endless days, O LORD.\",\"4\":\"Mightier than the thunder of the great waters, mightier than the breakers of the sea- the LORD on high is mighty.\"}"
