Unless the LORD watches over the city, the watchmen stand guard in vain.\",\"3\":\"Sons are a heritage from the LORD, children a reward from him.\",\"2\":\"In vain you rise early and stay up late, toiling for food to eat- for he grants sleep to those he loves.\",\"5\":\"Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them. They will not be put to shame when they contend with their enemies in the gate.\",\"4\":\"Like arrows in the hands of a warrior are sons born in one's youth.\"}"
