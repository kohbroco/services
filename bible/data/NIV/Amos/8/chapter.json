"{\"11\":\"\\\"The days are coming,\\\" declares the Sovereign LORD, \\\"when I will send a famine through the land- not a famine of food or a thirst for water, but a famine of hearing the words of the LORD.\",\"10\":\"I will turn your religious feasts into mourning and all your singing into weeping.
